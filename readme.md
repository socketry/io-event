# ![IO::Event](logo.svg)

Provides low level cross-platform primitives for constructing event loops, with support for `select`, `kqueue`, `epoll` and `io_uring`.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/io-event/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/io-event/actions?workflow=Test)

## Motivation

The initial proof-of-concept [Async](https://github.com/socketry/async) was built on [NIO4r](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r). It was perfectly acceptable and well tested in production, however being built on `libev` was a little bit limiting. I wanted to directly build my fiber scheduler into the fabric of the event loop, which is what this gem exposes - it is specifically implemented to support building event loops beneath the fiber scheduler interface, providing an efficient C implementation of all the core operations.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/io-event/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/io-event/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use `io-event` for non-blocking IO.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/io-event/releases/index) for all releases.

### v1.10.2

  - Improved consistency of handling closed IO when invoking `#select`.

### v1.10.0

  - `IO::Event::Profiler` is moved to dedicated gem: [fiber-profiler](https://github.com/socketry/fiber-profiler).
  - Perform runtime checks for native selectors to ensure they are supported in the current environment. While compile-time checks determine availability, restrictions like seccomp and SELinux may still prevent them from working.

### v1.9.0

  - Improved `IO::Event::Profiler` for detecting stalls.

### v1.8.0

  - Detecting fibers that are stalling the event loop.

### v1.7.5

  - Fix `process_wait` race condition on EPoll that could cause a hang.
